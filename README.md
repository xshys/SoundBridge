# SoundBridge

## Browser Extension (Chrome/Firefox) + Backend API (Node.js) + yt-dlp (Docker)

- ✅ Download YouTube video audio on-demand directly into your private media library (Jellyfin, Navidrome ecc...)
- ✅ No Web UI: everything is controlled from the browser extension
- ✅ No database: the filesystem is the single source of truth
- ✅ Security: API Key + LAN/VPN-only access (optional, exposed)

## Architecture

```
Browser Extension (MV3)
    │ HTTPS/HTTP REST API (LAN/VPN)
    ▼
Backend API (Node.js)
    │ docker exec
    ▼
yt-dlp container
    │
    ▼
/mylibrary/media/music/<folder>/
    ▼
Jellyfin/Navidrome → Music Client iOS, Android or Desktop/Browser
```
I personally use Finamp(iOS) for listen my Jellyfin music library

## Requirements:

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A server running media server with a music library pointed to /mylibrary/media/music (or of cource your path, set also to .env)
- This project (API + yt-dlp) and browser extension

## Open Source Media Server Examples
- Jellyfin (https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
- Navidrome (https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/)
- Gonic (https://github.com/sentriz/gonic)
...And many mores that you can find in the big open source community, most important requirement is a folder to build your personal library

## Installation (Server)

1) Copy backend folder on your server

2) Set your [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/xShys/SoundBridge/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml)

3) Configure environment variables
Create/modify backend/.env:

```
PORT=8787
API_KEY=CHANGE_ME_LONG_RANDOM
MUSIC_ROOT=/mylibrary/media/music
YTDLP_CONTAINER=yt-dlp-music
CORS_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://*,moz-extension://*

# Audio (optional)
AUDIO_FORMAT=mp3
AUDIO_QUALITY=0
NORMALIZE_AUDIO=0
LOUDNORM_TARGET=-14

# Playlist / concurrency (optional)
MAX_PLAYLIST_ITEMS=50
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=2
```

Audio options (all optional, the defaults reproduce the behaviour of previous versions):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AUDIO_FORMAT` | `mp3` | Output format: `mp3`, `m4a`, `opus`, `flac`, `best`. An unknown value falls back to `mp3`. |
| `AUDIO_QUALITY` | `0` | yt-dlp audio quality: `0`-`9` (0 = best) or a bitrate such as `192K`. |
| `NORMALIZE_AUDIO` | `0` | `1` normalizes loudness to EBU R128 while extracting the audio. |
| `LOUDNORM_TARGET` | `-14` | Target integrated loudness in LUFS (`-14` streaming reference, `-16` for spoken content). |
| `MAX_PLAYLIST_ITEMS` | `50` | Hard cap on tracks downloaded from a single playlist. |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` | `2` | Jobs allowed to run at once; further requests get `429`. |

⚠️ **Normalization rewrites the audio and is irreversible**: files already in your library are never
touched, but a normalized download cannot be "un-normalized" without downloading it again. It also
roughly doubles the processing time per track. Leave it off unless volume differences bother you.

Tags (`artist`, `title`, `album`, cover art) are always embedded: titles like
`Artist - Song (Official Video)` are cleaned and split into the proper artist/title tags, and
tracks downloaded from a playlist get the playlist name as `album`.

Tip: generate a long random key for api key:

```
openssl rand -hex 32
```

4) Verify music mount
Make sure the folder exists and is writable:

```
sudo mkdir -p /mylibrary/media/music
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mylibrary/media/music
```

5) Run with Docker Compose

```
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f api
```

6) Test the API (LAN)
From the server:

```
curl -s http://localhost:8787/api/health
```

From a PC on the LAN:

```
curl -s http://<LAN_SERVER_IP>:8787/api/health
```

Test the folders endpoint:

```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer CHANGE_ME_LONG_RANDOM" http://<LAN_SERVER_IP>:8787/api/music/folders
```

## Browser Extension Installation
Chrome/Edge:

Install from [Chrom Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/acdhgbaglaikedbbejccmmhegglmdpnl?utm_source=item-share-cb)

Firefox:
Install from [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/soundbridge/)

OR manual install to try extension
Chrome/Edge:
- Go to: chrome://extensions
- Enable Developer mode
- Click Load unpacked
- Select the extension folder "/extension"

Firefox (MV3):
Firefox supports MV3 with some differences; for testing:

- Go to: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
- Click Load Temporary Add-on
- Select extension/manifest.json

## Extension Configuration:
Open the extension options and set:

- API Base URL: http://<LAN_SERVER_IP>:8787 (the scheme is added automatically if you omit it)
- API Key: the one in backend/.env
- Press Test Connection → it should display Connection OK ✅
- Notifications (optional): get a desktop notification when a download finishes, even with the
  popup closed. Enabling it asks for an extra browser permission; disabling it gives the
  permission back and stops all background activity.
- Favorite folders (optional): save up to 10 folder names. They show up in the popup as
  one-click buttons, so you don't have to scroll a long list every time. A favorite that does
  not exist on the server yet is created on the first download into it.

The popup also remembers the last folder you downloaded into and pre-selects it.

Closing the popup does not interrupt anything: the download runs on the server. Re-open it and
the log and the progress come back exactly where they were - they are re-read from the API, the
extension stores no log of its own. With notifications enabled you also get told when it is over
without re-opening anything.

## Usage:

- Open any YouTube video
- Click the extension icon
- Select a folder or type a new target folder
- Click "Download Audio"

For a playlist URL (or a video opened from a playlist), a **Download the whole playlist**
checkbox appears: tick it to fetch every track into the same folder, up to `MAX_PLAYLIST_ITEMS`.
Progress is shown as `Track 3/12`. Auto-generated mixes (`list=RD...`) work too: they never
declare a total, so `MAX_PLAYLIST_ITEMS` is what ends them. Watch Later and Liked videos are not
supported - they are tied to your account and yt-dlp cannot see them without login cookies.
Tracks get the playlist name as their `album` tag. Leave the box unticked and only the single
video is downloaded, exactly as before.

After the download completes, Your media server (like Jellyfin, Navidrome ecc...) will index the new files (according to its scheduled scanning settings).

Security (LAN/VPN Only)

Minimum recommendations:
- Do NOT expose port 8787 to the internet (NO router port forwarding)
- Use a strong API Key
- Keep rate limiting enabled (already included)
- UFW (optional but recommended)

Example: allow port 8787 only from LAN 192.168.1.0/24:
```
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8787 proto tcp
sudo ufw deny 8787/tcp
sudo ufw status verbose
```

If using WireGuard, allow only the VPN subnet (e.g., 10.8.0.0/24):
```
sudo ufw allow from 10.8.0.0/24 to any port 8787 proto tcp
sudo ufw deny 8787/tcp
```

Note:
The browser extension makes HTTP requests to the LAN server.
On “guest” or segmented networks, ensure the user's PC can reach the server.

## ⚠️ Optional: Exposing the API (ADVANCED USERS ONLY)

## Disclaimer – Security Warning
This project is designed to work LAN/VPN-only by default.
Exposing the API to the public internet is NOT recommended unless you fully understand the security implications.

If you expose this API:
- Use HTTPS only
- Protect it with strong API keys
- Restrict access with IP allowlists, VPN, or authentication middleware
- Never expose Docker directly

The maintainers are NOT responsible for misconfigurations, data loss, or abuse caused by public exposure.

Option 1 — Exposing the API with Traefik (Recommended)
This option is suitable if you already run Traefik as a reverse proxy for Jellyfin or other services.

Requirements:
- Traefik v2+
- HTTPS enabled (Let’s Encrypt or internal CA)

API container must NOT expose ports publicly

docker-compose.yml (Traefik labels)
Remove the ports: section from the API container and add Traefik labels:
```
services:
  api:
    image: node:20-alpine
    container_name: yt-audio-api
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
      - /mylibrary/media/music:/music
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.env
    command: sh -lc "apk add --no-cache docker-cli && npm i && npm run start"
    networks:
      - traefik
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"

      # Router
      - "traefik.http.routers.ytapi.rule=Host(`yt-api.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.ytapi.entrypoints=https"
      - "traefik.http.routers.ytapi.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.ytapi.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"

      # Service
      - "traefik.http.services.ytapi.loadbalancer.server.port=8787"

      # Middlewares (RECOMMENDED)
      - "traefik.http.routers.ytapi.middlewares=ytapi-ipallow@docker,ytapi-headers@docker"

      # IP allowlist (example: LAN + VPN)
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ytapi-ipallow.ipallowlist.sourcerange=192.168.1.0/24,10.8.0.0/24"

      # Security headers
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ytapi-headers.headers.customrequestheaders.X-Forwarded-Proto=https"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ytapi-headers.headers.framedeny=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ytapi-headers.headers.contenttypenosniff=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.ytapi-headers.headers.browserxssfilter=true"

    restart: unless-stopped
networks:
  traefik:
    external: true
```

API Base URL (Extension)
https://yt-api.example.com

Traefik Security Notes:
- Do NOT expose without ipallowlist
- Prefer VPN-only access
- Do not rely on API Key alone if exposed publicly

Option 2 — Exposing the API with NGINX
Use this if you don’t run Traefik and prefer a traditional reverse proxy.

Requirements:

- NGINX
- HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt or equivalent)
- API listening on 127.0.0.1:8787 or Docker internal network

Example NGINX Virtual Host
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yt-api.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/yt-api.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yt-api.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # OPTIONAL: restrict by IP (strongly recommended)
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;
    allow 10.8.0.0/24;
    deny all;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;

        proxy_read_timeout 900;
        proxy_connect_timeout 30;

        client_max_body_size 256k;
    }
}
```

API Base URL (Extension)
https://yt-api.example.com

Strongly Recommended Hardening (If Exposed)

1️⃣ Use VPN-only Access

Best practice:
- Expose API only inside WireGuard / OpenVPN
- Do not allow public IPs

2️⃣ Firewall (UFW example)
## Allow VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.8.0.0/24 to any port 443 proto tcp

## Block everything else
sudo ufw deny 443/tcp
sudo ufw status verbose

3️⃣ Rotate API Keys
- Treat API keys like passwords
- Change immediately if leaked

Final Recommendation
Default mode (LAN-only, no reverse proxy) is the safest and recommended setup.

Expose the API only if:

- You already expose Jellyfin or other services
- You understand reverse proxies
- You restrict access via VPN or IP allowlists
- You accept the security responsibility

## Troubleshooting:

1) docker exec does not work

The API container uses /var/run/docker.sock.
Check that it is correctly mounted in your docker-compose file.

Verify the container name:

YTDLP_CONTAINER=yt-dlp-music

2) Download fails / throttling

YouTube may throttle requests.
Try a different URL and avoid playlists (--no-playlist is already enabled).

Check logs:

```
docker compose logs -f yt-audio-api
```

3) Files end up with strange names

--restrict-filenames is enabled for safety and compatibility.

4) Media server (Jellyfin, Navidrome ecc...) does not detect new files

- Make sure the media server points to the same directory
-Trigger Scan Library or enable automatic scanning


## Roadmap:

- ✅ Playlist download
- ✅ Preset folders
- ✅ Audio tagging / ID3 + normalization (see `NORMALIZE_AUDIO` above)
- ✅ Browser notifications
